# Credit Risk Classification

## Overview of the Analysis
* Uses a logistic regression model and historical lending data to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
* Our independent variable was loan_status, which could be either '0' for health loans or '1' for high-risk loans.
* Uses the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing data.


## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy: 99%
  * Precision: '0' 100%, '1' 86%
  * Recall scores: '0' 99%, '1' 90%

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* The model has a 99% accuracy score, however it is better at predicting healthy loans. This may be because the data includes many more healthy loans.
* I would recommend the model because it has a high accuracy score. Even though it predicts healthy loans better, the preicision and recall scores for high-risk loans are both above 85%.
